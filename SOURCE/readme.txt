VCGUI sourcecode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VCGUI is developed with WDSibyl, see www.wdsibyl.org.
Before using the path settings in the projectfile OS2VC.SPR
must be adjusted.

That are at first the paths of the WDSIBYL installation, all
entries, in which the path D:\PROG\WDSIBYL exists.

Second the projekt folder D:\PROG\WDSIBYL\PROJECTS\OS2CVS, this folder
can be anywhere, it not must reside in the path structure of WDSIBYL.
